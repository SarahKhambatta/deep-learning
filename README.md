# Deep Learning Project

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing deep learning models to solve a specific problem using neural networks. It leverages frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch to develop, train, and evaluate models.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Model architecture design (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, etc.)
- Training and hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Deployment and inference

## Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/deep-learning-project.git
cd deep-learning-project

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dependencies
The project requires the following libraries:
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- OpenCV (if working with images)

## Usage
To train the model, use:
```bash
python train.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 32 --learning_rate 0.001
```

To evaluate the model:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model checkpoint.pth
```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project should be placed in the `data/` directory. It should be preprocessed using `preprocess.py` before training.

## Results
Model performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, and visualizations are saved in the `results/` directory.

## Contribution
To contribute:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`)
3. Commit changes (`git commit -m 'Add feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-name`)
5. Create a Pull Request
